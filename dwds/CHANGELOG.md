- Fix issue where certain required fields of VM service protocol objects were
  null.
- Properly display `Closure` names in the debug view.

## 0.5.0

- Added a check to tests for the variable DWDS_DEBUG_CHROME to run Chrome with a
  UI rather than headless.
- Catch unhandled errors in `client.js` and recommend using the
  `--no-injected-client` flag for webdev users.
- Add support for an SSE connection with Dart DevTools.
- Rename `wsUri` to `uri` on `DebugConnection` to reflect that the uri may not
  be a websocket.
- Depend on latest `package:vm_service`.

## 0.4.0

- Move `data` abstractions from `package:webdev` into `package:dwds`.
- Move debugging related handlers from `package:webdev` into `package:dwds`.
- Move injected client from `package:webdev` into `package:dwds`.

## 0.3.3

## 0.2.1

## 0.2.0

- Added custom tokens to the `wsUri` for increased security.

    getter to get a valid uri for connecting to the service, when previously
    combining the port and host was sufficient.
