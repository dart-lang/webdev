## 1.0.1

- Make the `root` optional for the `ProxyServerAssetReader`.

## 1.0.0

- Fix an issue where files imported with relative paths containing `../` may fail
  to resolve breakpoint locations.
- Remove dependency on `package:build_daemon`.
- Add `FrontendServerAssetReader` for use with Frontend Server builds.
- Fix an issue where a failure to initiate debugging through the Dart Debug
  Extension would cause your development server to crash.
- Fix an issue where trying to launch DevTools in a non-debug enabled Chrome
  instance could crash your development server.

**Breaking Changes:**
- No longer use the `BuildResult` abstraction from `package:build_daemon` but
  require a similar abstraction provided by this package.
- `AssetHandler` has been renamed to `AssetReader` and no longer provides a
  generic resource handler. Specific methods for the required resources are now
  clearly defined. The new abstraction is now consumed through `dwds.dart`.
- `BuildRunnerAssetHandler` has been renamed to `ProxyServerAssetReader` and is
  now consumed through `dwds.dart`.

## 0.9.0

- Expose `middleware` and `handler`.

**Breaking Change:** The `AssetHandler` will not automatically be added the
  DWDS handler cascade. You must now also add the `middelware` to your server's
  pipeline.

## 0.8.5

- Always bind to `localhost` for the local debug workflow.
- Fix an issue where breakpoints could cause DevTools to hang.

## 0.8.4

- Support using WebSockets for the debug (VM Service) proxy by passing
  `useSseForDebugProxy: false` to `Dwds.start()`

## 0.8.3

- Support nesting Dart applications in iframes.

## 0.8.2

- Add the ability to receive events from the extension in batches.

## 0.8.1

- Depend on the latest `package:built_value`.

## 0.8.0

- Add temporary support for restoring breakpoints. Eventually the Dart VM
  protocol will clearly define how breakpoints should be restored.
- Depend on latest `package:sse` to get retry logic.
- Don't spawn DevTools if `serveDevTools` is false.
- `UrlEncoder` will also encode the base URI used by the injected client /
  Dart Debug Extension.
** Breaking Change ** `serveDevTools` is not automatically considered true if
  `enableDebugExtension`is true.

## 0.7.9

- Properly wait for hot reload to complete with the legacy module system.
- Fix issue with `getObject` for a class with a generic type.

## 0.7.8

- Support optional argument `urlEncoder` that is used to encode remote URLs for
  use with the Dart Debug Extension.

## 0.7.7

- Handle getObject for primitives properly.
- Properly black box scripts if query parameters are provided.

## 0.7.6

- Fix issue with source map logic for the legacy module system.
- Allow setting breakpoints multiple times and just return the old breakpoint.
- Fix a bug with Maps that contain lists of simple types.

## 0.7.5

- The injected client's connection is now based off the request URI.
- Fix an issue where resuming while paused at the start would cause an error.
- Expose the `ChromeDebugException` class for error handling purposes.
- Expose the `AppConnectionException` class for error handling purposes.
- DevTools will now launch immediately and lazily sets up necessary state.
- Properly set `pauseBreakpoints` on `kPauseBreakpoint` events.
- Greatly improves handling of List, Map and IdentityMap instances.
- Lazily parse source maps to improve performance for large applications.

## 0.7.4

- Deobfuscate DDC extension method stack traces.
- Properly get all libraries with the `legacy` module system.

## 0.7.3

- Correctly set `Isolate` state if debugging is initiated after the application
  has already started.

## 0.7.2

- Account for root directory path when using `package:` URIs with `DartUri`.

## 0.7.1

- Fix a bug where we would try to create a new isolate even for a failed
  hot restart. This created a race condition that would lead to a crash.
- Don't attempt to write a vm service request to a closed connection.
  - Instead we log a warning with the attempted request message and return.
- Make all `close` methods more robust by allowing them to be called more than
  once and returning the cached future from previous calls.
- Add explicit handling of app not loaded errors when handling chrome pause
  events.

## 0.7.0

- `DWDS.start` now requires an `AssetHandler` instead of `applicationPort`,
  `assetServerPort` and `applicationTarget`.
- Expose a `BuildRunnerAssetHandler` which proxies request to the asset server
  running within build runner.
- Support the Legacy Module strategy through the injected client.
- Support DDK sourcemap URIs.
- Update SDK dependency to minimum of 2.5.0.

### Bug Fixes:

- Fix handling of chrome pause events when we have no isolate loaded yet.

## 0.6.2

- Capture any errors that happen when handling SSE requests in the DevHandler
  and return an error response to the client code.
  - Log error responses in the client to the console.
- Handle empty Chrome exception descriptions.

## 0.6.1

- Add `isolateRef` to `Isolate`s `pauseEvent`s.
- Depend on the latest `package:vm_service`.
- Implements `invoke`.
- Adds support for VM object IDs for things that don't have Chrome object Ids
  (e.g. int, double, bool, null).

## 0.6.0

- Add new required parameter `enableDebugging` to `Dwds.start`. If `false` is
  provided, debug services will not run. However, reload logic will continue
  to work with the injected client.
- Handle injected client SSE errors.
- Handle a race condition when the browser is refreshed in the middle of setting
  up the debug services.

## 0.5.5

- Properly set the `pauseEvent` on the `Isolate`.
- Fix a race condition with Hot Restarts where the Isolate was not created in
  time for pause events.

## 0.5.4

- Fix issue where certain required fields of VM service protocol objects were
  null.
- Properly set the `exceptionPauseMode` on the `Isolate`.
- Depend on the latest `DevTools`.

## 0.5.3

- Fix issue where certain required fields of VM service protocol objects were
  null.

## 0.5.2

- Fix issue where certain required fields of VM service protocol objects were
  null.
- Properly display `Closure` names in the debug view.

## 0.5.1

- Fix an issue where missing source maps would cause a crash. A warning will
  now be logged to the console instead.
- Depend on the latest `package:webkit_inspection_protocol`.

## 0.5.0

- Fix an issue where we source map paths were not normalized.
- Added a check to tests for the variable DWDS_DEBUG_CHROME to run Chrome with a
  UI rather than headless.
- Catch unhandled errors in `client.js` and recommend using the
  `--no-injected-client` flag for webdev users.
- Add support for an SSE connection with Dart DevTools.
- Rename `wsUri` to `uri` on `DebugConnection` to reflect that the uri may not
  be a websocket.
- Depend on latest `package:vm_service`.

## 0.4.0

- Move `data` abstractions from `package:webdev` into `package:dwds`.
- Move debugging related handlers from `package:webdev` into `package:dwds`.
- Move injected client from `package:webdev` into `package:dwds`.
- Create new public entrypoint `dwds.dart`. Existing public API `services.dart`
  is now private.

## 0.3.3

- Add support for `getScript` for paused isolates.
- Add support for `onRequest` and `onResponse` listeners for the vm service.

## 0.3.2

## 0.3.1

  so it can be more easily reproduced.

## 0.3.0

- Change the exposed type on DebugService to VmServiceInterface

## 0.2.1

## 0.2.0

- Added custom tokens to the `wsUri` for increased security.

    getter to get a valid uri for connecting to the service, when previously
    combining the port and host was sufficient.

## 0.1.0

- Initial version
