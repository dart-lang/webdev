## 0.3.3-dev

- Handle `org-dartlang-app` scheme library uris and convert them to match the
  dart uris that we will see in the sourcemaps.

## 0.3.2

- Add support for `scope` in `evaluate` calls.

## 0.3.1

- Improve error reporting for evals, give the full JS eval in the error message
  so it can be more easily reproduced.

## 0.3.0

- Change the exposed type on DebugService to VmServiceInterface

## 0.2.1

- Support `setExceptionPauseMode`.

## 0.2.0

- Added custom tokens to the `wsUri` for increased security.
  - Treating this as a breaking change because you now must use the `wsUri`
    getter to get a valid uri for connecting to the service, when previously
    combining the port and host was sufficient.

## 0.1.0

- Initial version
