## 2.1.2

- Force kill the frontend server after one second when calling shutdown. It
  appears to hang on windows sometimes.

## 2.1.1

- Fix a bug where spaces in the output dill path would cause a parse error when
  reading the error count output.

## 2.1.0

- Support enabling experiments when starting the compiler.

## 2.0.1

- Widen the upper bound sdk constraint to `<3.0.0`. The frontend server api
  is now considered quite stable and this package is now depended on by
  package:test, so a tight constraint would cause unnecessary headaches.

## 2.0.0

- Support null safety.

## 1.0.0

- Initial version
