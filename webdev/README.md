# Experimental Usage

The example directory contains a package that is configured to work with
`pub run webdev <command>`. Support for `pub global activate webdev` and simply
adding a dev_dependency to your packages is coming soon.

## Commands

* __build__: Run builders to build a package.
* __help__: Display help information for webdev.
* __serve__: Run a local web development server and a file system watcher that
  re-builds on changes.
