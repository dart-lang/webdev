A command-line tool for developing and deploying web applications with Dart.

## Requirements

The latest release of `webdev` requires Dart SDK `2.10.0` or later.

To use `webdev` with a package, make sure you have entries in `pubspec.yaml`
similar to:

```yaml
...
dev_dependencies:
  build_runner: ^1.6.2
  build_web_compilers: ^2.0.0
...
```

*`build_web_compilers` `^1.2.0` is supported, but with some limited
functionality.*

## Installation

`webdev` is not meant to be used as a dependency. Instead, it should be
["activated"][activating].

```console
$ pub global activate webdev
```

Learn more about activating and using packages [here][pub global].

## Usage

`webdev` provides two commands: `serve` and `build`.

### `webdev serve`

```
Run a local web development server and a file system watcher that rebuilds on
changes.

Usage: webdev serve [arguments] [<directory>[:<port>]]...
    --auto                                 Automatically performs an action
                                           after each build:

                                           restart: Reload modules and re-invoke
                                           main (loses current state)
                                           refresh: Performs a full page
                                           refresh.
                                           [restart, refresh]
    --[no-]debug                           Enable the launching of DevTools (Alt
                                           + D / Option + D). This also enables
                                           --launch-in-chrome.
    --[no-]debug-extension                 Enable the backend for the Dart Debug
                                           Extension.
    --[no-]injected-client                 Whether or not to inject the
                                           client.js script in web apps. This is
                                           required for all debugging related
                                           features, but may interact poorly
                                           with proxy servers or other
                                           environments.
                                           (defaults to on)

Advanced:
    --chrome-debug-port                    Specify which port the Chrome
                                           debugger is listening on. If used
                                           with launch-in-chrome Chrome will be
                                           started with the debugger listening
                                           on this port.
    --hostname                             Specify the hostname to serve on.
                                           (defaults to "localhost")
    --[no-]launch-in-chrome                Automatically launches your
                                           application in Chrome with the debug
                                           port open. Use chrome-debug-port to
                                           specify a specific port to attach to
                                           an already running chrome instance
                                           instead.
    --log-requests                         Enables logging for each request to
                                           the server.
    --tls-cert-chain                       The file location to a TLS
                                           Certificate to create an HTTPs
                                           server.
                                           Must be used with tls-cert-key.
    --tls-cert-key                         The file location to a TLS Key to
                                           create an HTTPs server.
                                           Must be used with tls-cert-chain.

                                           the directory to write a filtered
                                           build output to. For example

                                           `build_web_compilers` is required to
                                           run.
