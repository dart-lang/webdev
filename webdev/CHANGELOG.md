## 2.2.0-dev

- Added a `fullReload` service extension which performs a full page refresh.

## 2.1.0

- Add an explicit error if there are no directories to serve. Typically this
  would happen if the user doesn't have a `web` directory.
- Add support for specifying `--hostname any`.
- DevTools no longer launches in a new window. This prevents an issue where
  pausing your application also pauses DevTools.
- Fix some edge cases for hot restart:
  - All restarts will now fire isolate create/destroy events, regardless of
    how they are triggered.
  - Fix a bug in the module invalidation/reload logic.

## 2.0.7

- Update minimum `package:build_runner` version to `1.5.0`.
- Use `HttpMultiServer` to fix bind issues with IPv6 / IPv4.

## 2.0.6

- Use latest `package:build_daemon`.

## 2.0.5

- Use `HttpMultiServer` to fix bind issues with IPv6 / IPv4.

## 2.0.4

  - Add a nice error if attempting to launch devtools in non-chrome browsers.
- Detect `flutter` and `flutter_test` dependencies and fail with a nice message.

## 2.0.3

- Support latest `package:build_daemon`.
- Fix Chrome issues while running through VS Code.

## 2.0.2

- Support `package:dwds` version `0.3.0`.

## 2.0.1

## 2.0.0

## Breaking Changes

- The `serve` command will now only serve `web` by default.
- Deprecated the `--hot-reload` and `--live-reload` flags, in favor of the new
  `--auto=<action>` option which performs an action whenever a build completes.
  - The current supported actions are `restart` and `refresh`, which correspond
    to the old `--hot-reload` and `--live-reload` flags.
- Support building with `package:build_daemon`. This allows shared builds as
  long as the build arguments are compatible.
  - This should not affect most users but might break some workflows.
  - Prompts are not supported, so you may have to pass the
    `-- --delete-conflicting-outputs` argument if you used to hit `y` at the
    prompt.

### Features

- Added the `--debug` flag.
  - Runs a proxy dart vm service with limited functionality, which talks to the
    running in chrome.
  - Enables [devtools](https://github.com/flutter/devtools) for web apps.
    - For regular web apps currently this doesn't actually do anything yet,
      except for supported frameworks which will enable some tabs.
    - Use `alt+d` (or `option+d` on Mac) in the web app to launch devtools.
- Allow build_web_compilers 2.x.
