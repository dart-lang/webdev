/// Tests for constant semantics across hot restart in DDC.
///
/// DDC has multiple layers of constant caching. Failing to clear them can
/// result in stale constants being referenced across hot restarts.
///
/// Cases tested include:
/// 1) Failing to clear all constant caches.
///   An old 'ConstObject' is returned, which fails to reflect the edited
///   'variableToModifyToForceRecompile'.
/// 2) Clearing constant caches but failing to clear constant containers.
///   Constants in reloaded modules fail to compare with constants in stale
///   constant containers, causing 'ConstantEqualityFailure's.
