# This code is for testing that the debugger works with weak null-safety
# so we should not migrate it to null-safety.
# TODO(elliette): Delete this directory post Dart 3.0 (when we no longer

  A test fixture for webdev testing with weak null-safety.


# The versions in this pubspec should match the requirements
# defined by webdev. That is the SDK constraint should be the
# same as defined by webdev/pubspec.yaml and the build_runner
# and build_web_compilers constraint should match those defined
# in pubspec.dart.
